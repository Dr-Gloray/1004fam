            I am GOD’s favorite child, thee anointed, highly favored, blessed, beloved, chosen, protected, preserved and provided for.
            My life motto is 'GOD OVER EVERYTHING' 
            Honestly, God is the Love of my life because he has seen me go through the most and still stick with me.
            I love shopping ,hosting events , cleaning and laughing . 
            I love preaching the Gospel by allowing God use me to be a blessing to many. 
            I love giving , for it’s more blessed to give than receive and for GOD loves a cheerful giver . 
            I love making beautiful memories , taking pictures and enjoying the moment for life is too short to be boring .
            Definitly I love being a reason for someone’s happiness and reason they believe in good people .
            I love it when people look at me and see GOD through me and say indeed she serves a living GOD .
            I don’t like anything that disturbs my Peace .
            My Joy is everything because the Joy of the Lord is my strength. 
            My favorite Bible verses are Psalms 23, Numbers 6:24-26 and Romans 8:28. 
            And one thing I know for sure is that, I will become a Rich, Famous, wealthy and a successful woman in future.

            One Advice to whoever happens to read this is that ‘Put God first in everything you do , be kind and loving to people , 
            be a reason someone believes in kindness and good people . Live your best life and embrace the moment. 
            And do what makes you happy’
            Lastly, it’s my prayer that may the peace of GOD that surpasses all understanding be upon us all . 
            May we all live a good and beautiful life to witness the love of GOD in all that concerns us. 
            Shalom.

            She has been described by people as quite unfriendly but that is because
            they simply do not know her.
            She is an overthinker who is in her own head half of the time

            all the comotion. I love them all, really. But I am still and always 
            gonna choose you. I know you know yourself. The 'A' in your name matches
            the 'A' in mine.
